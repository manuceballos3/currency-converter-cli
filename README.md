# Currency Converter CLI

A simple command-line currency converter built with JavaScript and Node.js.  
It uses the public API from exchangerate.host to fetch real-time exchange rates.

## Features
- Convert any amount between two currencies.
- Runs entirely from the terminal.
- Short, readable code.
- Great first project to demonstrate JavaScript and API usage.
